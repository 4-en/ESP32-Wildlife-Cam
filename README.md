# ESP32 Based Wildlife Camera
The aim of this project is to develop an advanced wildlife camera that leverages the capabilities of the ESP32 microcontroller. This camera will be specifically designed to autonomously detect wildlife through motion detection, capture images, identify animal species, and provide an interface for user interaction and information display.
