# ESP32 Based Wildlife Camera

The aim of this project is to develop an advanced wildlife camera that leverages the capabilities of the ESP32 microcontroller. This camera will be specifically designed to autonomously detect wildlife through motion detection, capture images, identify animal species, and provide an interface for user interaction and information display.

## Features

- [x] Motion Detection: Either with PIR sensor or with camera, depending on tests.
- [x] Photo Storage: Storing images on sd card with timestamp
- [x] Button Controls: Allows users to manually adjust some setting settings (time, detection, image count) and start/stop detection.
- [x] Display: Incorporates a small screen to display a menu for controls, information about detected animals, and other relevant data.
- [ ] Optional: Wireless interface (viewing images, controls)

## Roadmap
- [x] Setup environment
- [x] Test camera
- [x] Test storage
- [x] Test motion detection methods
- [x] Button controls and display
